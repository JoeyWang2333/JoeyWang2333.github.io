Welcome to Joey Yijie Wang's home on the Web.

Introduction 
======
I was graduated from Soochow University(Mainland China)(蘇州大學) majoring in Chinese Language and Literature. I will join University of California, Los Angeles as a M.A. in East Asian Studies student in 2023 Fall semester.

I am interested in literature, material culture, memory studies and post-colonial theory. At present the area of my specialization is China. My undergraduate thesis for B.A. degree was focused on the relationships among objects, craftsmanship and memory in Ge Liang's(葛亮） novels. I am studying German and Japanese. 
  
I was fortunate to work with Prof. Allison Ye Qin and Jin Ji when I was in Soochow University. Besides, I have also done an internship in Research Center for Digital Humanities of Peking University from Oct. 2022 to Jun. 2023, supervised by Prof. Hao Yang. 

I love foods. Suzhou and Los Angeles are both ideal places for me since I can find various kinds of delicious food there. Now I am interested in physics and I am self-learning Chinese-standard senior-high-school physics, including CPhO contexts. I have not studied physics anymore since 2018，so learning physics for me is a little bit challenging. However, it is charming and exciting, because physics always works!
